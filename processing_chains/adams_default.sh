# Find roads that are the most curved or twisty based on Open Street Map (OSM) data.
#
# This directory contains a number of scripts that together form the tool-chain for
# processing OpenStreetMap (OSM) geographic data and converting it to various types
# of helpful outputs. To maintain flexibility, each of these scripts is independent
# and can be run in mostly arbitrary orders to achieve different results. After the
# OpenStreetMap "ProtocolBuffers" (.pbf) data has been read, subsequent filter and
# modification scripts read and write data from Standard-In and Standard-Out buffers
# in an intermediate "MessagePack" data format. If you'd like to modify the data in
# a slightly different way than is provided, it is relatively easy to write your own
# filter, modification script, or output script and add it to your own processing
# sequence.
#
# This shell-script is an example processing sequence that will take an input slice
# of OSM data (such as those provided by Geofabrik.de) in .pbf or .osm format then
# process it and output it as a trio of KMZ files that highlight the most twisty roads
# in the input data.

  # Take the following processing steps first:

  # 2. Filter out unpaved ways and highway types we aren't interested in.
  # 3. Add segments and their lengths & radii.
  # 4. Calculate the curvature and filter curvature values for "deflections" (noisy data)
  # 5. Split our collections on long straight-aways (longer than 1.5 miles) to avoid
  #    highlighting long straight roads with infrequent curvy-sections.
  # 6. Sum the length and curvature of the sections in each way for reuse.
  # 7. Filter out collections not meeting our minimum curvature thresholds.
  # 3. Sort the items by their curvature value.
  # 3. Save the intermediate data.
